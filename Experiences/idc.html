        <h1>Integrated Design Challenge</h1>
        <p>May 2014 for ECE 110</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>In the ECE 110L Integrated Design Challenge, the team had to create a group of robots in order to stop the Galactic Empire and destroy the Death Star. Each robot had to follow a line, collect, integrate, and display the required information along the way, and then communicate with the other robots to proceed down the ventilation shaft in order. The section seven team had the additional challenge of only having four robots, each of which could obtain one of five numbers. Therefore, there was a number that would be missing, and this had to be accounted for.

        <h2>My Part: Yellow Squadron</h2>
        <p>"The yellow squadron had to follow a pre-calculated path and detect which of the three possible plasma lines, i.e. LED lights, were on. The pattern of activation had to be converted to a binary number and then communicated with the team of robots in order to go down the ventilation shaft at the right time."
        </p>
        <p>Basically, what my robot had to do was follow a line going around three lights, which each corresponded to a digit in a binary number. My robot had to determine which lights were on in order to determine the value of the binary numbers, which indicated the order in which my robot would proceed through the rest of the challenge board.

        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>In order to solve the Integrated Design Challenge, three QTI sensor circuits, a determined cutoff RC time, and logic were used to keep the robot on the line and to make it stop at the hash marks. Similarly, a phototransistor circuit and a determined cutoff RC time were used to determine whether each of the lights was on or off. The robot integrated the information to obtain a binary number, and three LED circuits were used to display the binary number obtained.
        </p>
        <p> Then, the robot proceeded to the staging area to wait for communication with the XBees. Similarly, all the other robots completed their respective challenges, obtained a number, and proceeded to the staging area. The first robot would continue down the ventilation shaft, and then send out its number. At the staging area, each of the robots would wait to obtain the number before their number or a pre-calculated amount of time that varied based on the speed of the slowest robot, and the number the robot received.
