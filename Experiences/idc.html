        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Some random facts about me. I'm North Carolina born and raised, a connoisseur of local barbecue, an aspiring world explorer, and an aficionado of brain teasers and mental exercises. I enjoy eating tons of great foods, feeling like shit afterwards, and then working my ass off at the gym the next day to burn the calories.
        </p>
        <p>I've always been a fan of math and science. Those subjects obviously come more naturally to me than writing. Before college, I thought I would make a career out of building robots or apps, but after having a few internships, I shifted my attention towards finance, since it's really a combination of a lot of technical and qualitative skills that I find interesting. I'll be an investment banking analyst starting this summer, but I'm hoping to continue working on my own computer science nerd projects in the off chance I have any time outside of work. 
        </p>
        <p>This website is one of those projects I want to keep up with. I'm working on building this website from scratch, without the aid of bootstrapping or frameworks. I'm hoping that this will allow me to develop my web design and coding skills, all while creating an interactive interface for my resume.
