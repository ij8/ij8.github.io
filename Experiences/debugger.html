        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Spring 2014 for CS 308</p>
        <p>I built a scolling-shooter game that I named "Debugger." I used the jgame library for the basic GUI design and implemented a rudimentary MVC design pattern for the function of the game. I also explored inheritance hierarchies for objects through this project.
        </p>
        <h2>Development Timeline</h2>
        <p>For the first few days after submitting my game plan, I spent about an hour or two each day looking through the examples in the tutorial. Rather than just looking at the code and figuring out how it worked, I modified the code in each example so that it could be applicable to my own project. Over the next few days until the due date, I spent around 10 hours applying what I learned from practicing with examples to my Debugger game. Much of the time working on the body of my code involved creating objects, troubleshooting collisions and other interactions between various objects, and configuring/calibrating automated movement for each object. I spent some time (perhaps 30 min in total) on creating my own splash and background images for the game.
        </p>

        <h2>Extensibility</h2>
        <p>It is fairly clear how to add new levels. In order to create a new level, a new void method could be created to initialize the objects defining the new type of level and this method could then be called by the defineLevel class. If methods are overly specific in what they accomplish, many of them will have to be made in order to accomplish a task and this will obfuscate code rather than clarify its function. Moving object classes (Ship, Bugger, PowerUp, etc.) to classes outside of Debugger and creating an abstract class to handle these classes would require significant modification of existing code.
